There are currently two games being tested and tweaked currently (and they are far from perfect).

The first is mobile friendly [Combo Hunter](/games/comboHunter.html).

The second is for desktop [(need a name)](/games/ntScoring.html).



## Combo Hunter
Once you clear a line, the next piece that locks without clearing anything is game over.

### Controls:
To move one can swipe left or right

To rotate tap the screen.
The piece will rotate differently based on which half of the screen you tapped on.

To hold, swipe up.

To lock a piece in place, swipe down or just wait for it to fall.

After a game over, tap anywhere.

On desktop, desktop controls will work as well.


## Desktop
Pieces fall, a full row clears everything away.

What's special here is if you form a 4 by 4 square (ie a square using 4 pieces) it will transform into gold (if only one colored piece was used) or silver (if multiple colors were used).
Line clears that contained gold or silver in it awarded bonus points.

### Controls:

move left and right: arrow keys, tap or hold

rotate clockwise: d

rotate cclockwise: s

rotate 180: f

hold: a

harddrop: space

reset: r
