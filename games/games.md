There are currently two games being tested and tweaked currently (and they are far from perfect).

The first is mobile friendly [Combo Hunter](https://wesln.com/dbm/comboHunter.html).

The second is for desktop [(need a name)](https://wesln.com/dbm/everythingBagel.html).

[(see all options)](https://wesln.com/dbm)

## Combo Hunter
A combo is formed by clearing a line and then with the next piece, clearing a line again.
A combo is broken when a piece locks into place without clearing any lines.
In this version, when a combo ends, the game does too.

A tutorial/missions version is in works and can be played
[here](https://wesln.com/dbm/comboHunterMissions.html).
If playing on desktop pressing "m" toggles between mission mode and main mode.


### Controls:
To move one can swipe left or right

To rotate tap the screen.
The piece will rotate differently based on which half of the screen you tapped on.

To hold, swipe up.

To lock a piece in place, swipe down or just wait for it to fall.

After a game over, tap anywhere.

On desktop, desktop controls will work as well.


## Desktop
Pieces fall, a full row clears everything away.

What's special here is if you form a 4 by 4 square with 4 pieces it transforms into something worth extra points.
If the square is formed with only one type of piece, it becomes gold, otherwise it becomes silver.


### Controls:

move left and right: arrow keys (tap or hold)

rotate clockwise: d

rotate cclockwise: s

rotate 180: f

hold: a

harddrop: space

reset: r
