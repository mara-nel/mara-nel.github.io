<h2 id="teaching">Teaching Statement</h2>

<blockquote>
People love watching buildings get demolished;
I love watching learning barriers get demolished.
Math is a subject rife with barriers.
The fixed mindset of 'not being a math person', math anxiety, inaccessible material, long monotonous lectures, large impersonal classes&mdash;these all plague the math classroom and are barriers to learning.
Incorporating classroom mindfulness, universal design for learning, and technology that brings the class together help bring these barriers down.

<h2 id="research">Research Statement</h2>

<blockquote>
My dissertation is on generalizations of Descartes’ Rule of Signs to multivariate polynomial systems.
It focuses on identifying conditions on the signs of negatively coupled Pham systems that gurantee that a positive real solution exists.
Future work will be in contributing to the growing body of knowledge about sums of nonnegative circuit (SONC) polynomials.
What follows is an introduction to Descartes’ Rule of Signs, my contributions in extending one aspect of this, and an introdution to SONC polynomials.
