   <p>Math is a very useful thing and a very helpful tool. Unfortunately, a lot of people suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_anxiety">math anxiety</a> or believe that they weren't gifted with being a 'math person.' While the first is very real, the second <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/well/family/trying-to-add-up-girls-and-math.html">might not be</a>. With humility and thanksgiving I can say that I grew up liking math. This has so far brought me to major in mathematics at my undergraduate college and to continue to study it at <a href="https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu">NCSU</a> (you can see me <a href="https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/wlnelson/">here</a>). </p>
   <p>I am still figuring out what my future involves, but teaching math, and more importantly helping people overcome their fear or distaste for it, is something I want to do.</p>
  <p>Outside of math, I also have fun by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>running</li>
    <li><a href="tetris.html">playing tetris</a></li>
    <li>carving wooden animals</li>
    <li><a href="books/">reading</a></li>
  </ul>
