  <p>Tetris is an incredible game. My first serious interactions with it was during my undergraduate studies, where my friends and I played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Tetris">The New Tetris</a> for the Nintendo 64. This is one of the few iterations in which 4x4 large squares can be formed and get turned into gold or obsidian blocks. This is referred to as "square mode" in <a href="https://harddrop.com/wiki/NullpoMino">NullpoMino</a></p>

  <p>Currently I play using <a href="http://farter.tk/tetr.js/">Farter's Dig Mod</a>, a lightweight JavaScript based browser game. I enjoy the <b>dig</b> and <b>dig hard</b> modes and would like to become better at <b>sprint</b>.</p>

  <p> My current best round in <b>dig</b> mode has the replay:</p>
