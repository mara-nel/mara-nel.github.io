description:
    summary: "The game of Scrabble has a competitive scene, and in that scene, there's a lot you need to know. This is a little companion app that I used to help me memorize a small subset of the 'bare minimum' sets of words a competive Scrabble player should know. As I traveled to different tournaments and met up at clubs, I was able to interview players about what they'd want in a training tool and being able to incorporate that feedback was a joy."
    tech: "This is a simple React application deployed through Github Pages. It uses sounds from <a href='https://zapsplat.com'>Zapsplat.com</a> and gets definitions from the <a href='https://dictionaryapi.dev'>Free Dictionary Api</a>."
    challenge: "The biggest challenge was that as a professional software engineer, I try to limit the amount of coding work I do outside of work. I do this to protect myself, but, it means that various enhancements I'd love to make, might not get addressed right away. Next steps would be to minimize the amount of calls I make to the leveraged dictionary API and to implement a tile dragging feature."
