description:
    summary: "In the game Tetris, when a row on the gameboard is filled it gets cleared. Repeatedly clearing lines with consecutive pieces is called a combo. Combo Mambo is a game with a narrower gameboard and where your goal is to get the highest combo. It's fast-paced and unforgiving."
    tech: "Combo Mambo is built with just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The gameboard is rendered using the Canvas API."
    challenge: "Early versions only had two modes: what's now titled challenge mode and missions. In challenge mode, the game ends once a player's combo is broken (which is when a line is cleared but the next piece doesn't also clear a line). Watching people play revealed that some new players didn't know why the game was ending and got frustrated. This led me to create the mode '49 Piece Practice', where a combo breaking wasn't game over, and instead, your score just reset to zero (this mode's name comes from the round ending after 49 pieces). I found that this introduction to the game didn't as severely violate the expectations of Tetris gameplay that people brought to this game and provided a more forgiving entry to learn Combo Mambo's main objective."
