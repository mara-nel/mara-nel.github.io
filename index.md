  My name is Wyn Nelson and I am a web application developer.
  </p>
  <p>
  Currently, I am a full-stack developer at the 
  <a href="https://itre.ncsu.edu/">Institute for Transportation Research & Education</a>
  working with multiple program groups such as its 
  <a href="https://itre.ncsu.edu/focus/bike-ped/">bicycle and pedestrian group</a>
  and its
  <a href="https://itre.ncsu.edu/focus/transit/">public transportation group</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The majority of my work uses HTML/CSS and Javascript with a Node.js server running Express.
  The current Javascript-based web frameworks I work with are React and Vue.js.
  On 
  <a href="/projects">my projects tab</a>,
  you can explore some of the projects I've designed, implemented, and deployed.
