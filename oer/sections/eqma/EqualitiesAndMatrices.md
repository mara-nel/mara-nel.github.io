<p>
This section introduces linear systems of equalities and various ways to solve them.
</p>

<p>
In the first two lessons linear functions and systems of linear equalities are defined.
Graphical and algebraic methods are explored as methods for answering related questions.
</p>

<p>
In the last three lessons matrices and different ways they can be used to solve systems of equations are introduced. 
Two ways that are explored are row reduction and matrix inversion.
