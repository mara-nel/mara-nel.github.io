<p>
In this section various counting methods are introduced and used to calculate more complex probability questions.
</p>

<p>
The first two lessons go over different counting methods. 
In lesson one the decision algorithm is introduced as a framework for recognizing and organizing the additive and mulitplicative principles.
In lesson two permutations and combinations are defined and formulas for them are derived and explained.
</p>

<p>
In the third lesson the counting techniques of lesson 1 and 2 are used to calculate the probability of given events.
</p>

<p>
The last two lessons explore conditional probability and define terms such as independence and mutaul exclusivity.
Lesson 5 specifically deals with Bayes' theorem and word problems that utilize it.
