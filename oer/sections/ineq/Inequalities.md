<p>
In this section systems of inequalities and linear programming are introduced.
</p>

<p>
In the first lesson graphing inequalities and systems of inequalites are shown.
Terms like feasible region and terms related to it&#8212;corners, bounded, unbounded&#8212; are defined.
</p>

<p>
The last two lessons revolve around linear programming problems and how to solve them either graphically or by the simplex method.
A conceptual overview of what the simplex method is and an online simplex solver are shown.
