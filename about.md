    <p>My current position involves me working with many facets of transportation.
      I develop applications that monitor bicycle and pedestrian counts, manage community transportation systems, and improve enforcement of commercial vehicle regulations.
      I enjoy working in many different groups and how many of them relate to urban planning.
    </p>
    <p>Before this, I was in a PhD program in mathematics (where in my spare time I fiddled with 
    <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>
    and taught myself Javascript).
    Part of my role as a graduate student was lecturing and in my pursuit of being a better educator, I learned about 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Design_for_Learning">Universal Design for Learning</a>.
    Eventually, this led to my discovery of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">UX Design</a>
    and my realization that I wanted to develop applications that centered the people that use them.
    So I left with a master's degree to do exactly that.

    Also, I read a lot.
    You can see what through my
