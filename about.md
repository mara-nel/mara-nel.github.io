<p> 
As a teaching graduate student at 
<a class="external" href="https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu">NC State University</a>
I have spent the last four years becoming a better communicator.
I must ask myself the question
"How can I better communicate this information to my audience?"
when creating course materials or research presentations.
When this question is directed at the products I create, it becomes a question about good design.
</p>

<p>
I recently realized that user experience (UX) design's creative, collaborative, and impactful nature makes it a career that I wish to pursue.
The principles of 
<a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">
UX design</a>
were first introduced to me during my undergraduate studies in computer science and I have since further explored it through books, personal projects, and a design bootcamp.
</p>

<p>
I am currently looking for a position that pairs my experience with web development and expertise in problem solving with UX design.
In the meantime, I apply elements from the UX design process&mdash;cognitive empathy, iterative design, use of user feedback&mdash;to be a better educator.

Outside of that, I've been reading a lot.
