<p> 
During my graduate studies in mathematics I spent a lot of extracurricular time developing web projects and reading books.
Through this I realized two things:
that I was deeply interested in the fields of UX design and urban planning
and that my web development experience could help make a career in these possible.
<p>

<p>
My current position at <a href="https://itre.ncsu.edu/">ITRE</a> allows me to work on transportation related projects in a web developer role.
