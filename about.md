Math is a very useful thing and a very helpful tool.
Unfortunately, a lot of people suffer from 
[math anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_anxiety)
or believe that they weren't gifted with being a 'math person.'
While the first is very real, the second
[is disputable](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/well/family/trying-to-add-up-girls-and-math.html).
With humility and thanksgiving I can say that I grew up liking math.
This has so far brought me to major in mathematics at my undergraduate college and to continue to study it at 
[NCSU](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu)
(you can see me [here](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/wlnelson/)).

I am still figuring out what my future involves, but teaching math, and more importantly helping people overcome their fear or distaste for it, is something I want to do.


Outside of math, I've been [reading a lot](/reading/).
